Recursion is when a function calls itself until a specified condition is met


void f() {
    print(1)
    f()
}
This function has no end, it will keep calling itself. Stack will keep getting accumulated with more
and more items resulting it getting full where eventually it will have no space to store more function calls

Gotta add a base condition

count = 0
void f() {
    if (count == 4) {
        return;
    }
    print(count);
    count++;
    f();
}

Recursion Tree
f() -> f() -> f() -> f()
count = 1, count = 2, count = 3, count = 4
